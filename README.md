This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming involving mutable borrows. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to create multiple mutable references to the same variable, resulting in a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.rs` file shows the corrected code using techniques to avoid this issue.
